# Hi, I'm Jimmy 👋

## Full-Stack Developer | Sim Racing Enthusiast | Building AI Tools for Real Life

I'm a developer at [iRacing](https://www.iracing.com) where I get to combine my passion for motorsports with my love for building great software. After dropping out of college, teaching myself to code, and earning my Associates in IT, I found my dream job where I was a customer long before I became an employee.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

- **AI-Powered Family Tools**: Creating practical AI applications that automate the mundane and enrich daily life
- **Voice-Enabled Scorekeeper**: Building a universal card game scoring app that works with any game via voice/text input
- **Personal Finance Intelligence**: Developing AI tools to analyze spending patterns and provide actionable lifestyle insights

### 💻 Tech Stack & Expertise

**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, React Router, Chakra UI  
**Build Tools:** Vite, Webpack, React Router Vite Plugin, Babel  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, API Development  
**Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
**Exploring:** AI/LLM Integration, Voice Recognition, MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### 🏁 Professional Journey

Started my tech career in 2005 after realizing sports management wasn't my path. Self-taught developer who weathered the 2008 recession, earned an Associates in IT from UMass Lowell (2017), and landed at iRacing in 2018 - proof that passion and persistence matter more than traditional credentials.

### 🎯 Current Focus

- Building AI tools that solve real problems for families
- Exploring practical applications of LLMs in everyday workflows  
- Contributing to open source projects that matter
- Maintaining sustainable work-life balance as a father
